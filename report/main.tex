\section{Coffee in society}
\label{sec:coffee-in-society}
In recent years, coffee has gained more and more popularity, cementing itself as one of the most widely consumed beverages.
Along with a surge in caf{\eaccentmark} openings, preparing coffee at home is now an activity enjoyed by more and more people, with the average consumer being more discerning and critical than ever.

The development of the coffee industry is often described as a series of ``waves''.
The first ``wave'' made coffee an everyday staple, focusing on convenience and high availability.
During the second wave, the idea of ``specialty'' coffee first entered the consumer vocabulary, with creative recipes, flavours and textures being popularised by emerging caf{\eaccentmark}s and chains.
The third wave, starting around 1980 and lasting to the present day saw a significant shift in consumer values:
rather than adding additional flavours in their coffee drinks, the consumers instead started noticing the taste characteristics of the beans themselves,
with simpler, more delicately flavoured drinks being preferred.
It is also during this time that coffee processing and roasting were moved into focus,
with the average consumer being more and more likely to differentiate and prefer a certain flavour profile over others.

The popularity of brewing ``specialty'' coffee at home has also risen during this time.
A coffee enthusiast is now more likely to own a grinder and one or more brewers, preferring to purchase whole-bean,
usually single-origin coffee, with the expectation of the resulting drink matching the advertised flavour and aroma notes.

It should also be noted that the preference in roast levels have also shifted as the waves changed.
During the second wave, when additional flavours and textures were the key focus of drinks,
a darker roast was preferred, as espresso produced with a darker roasted bean will have a more mellow,
sweet taste, with little to no acidity (though, a higher chance of bitterness if the coffee / water ratios are not correct),
and a thicker, heavier body.
With this style of preparation, an equal ratio of water to ground coffee is used, yielding a smaller, more intense espresso.

In contrast, a ``third-wave'' coffee preparation style values the acidity and floral notes that can only be retained
through a very light, gentle roasting process.
For many modern coffee enthusiasts, the lightest possible roast level is the most desirable.
While an under-roasted bean will taste unpleasant to a vast majority, with grassy, vegetal notes,
a roast level above ``medium'' is thought to mask away the harder to retain flavour notes
coming from either the coffee processing method, its origin or both.
As lighter roasted coffee is less soluble and therefore more difficult to extract,
modern coffee establishments often use higher coffee to water ratios, with 1:3 or even 1:5 ratios used to brew espresso.
Drinks brewed this way sacrifice a thicker body for clarity and brightness of flavour, exposing as much of the bean's
flavour profile as possible.
With the coffee flavour placed front-and-center, it is now more important than ever for coffee producers to deliver
the best possible quality of their product.

This shift of consumer patterns has placed a lot of importance on coffee roasters and farmers,
who are now held to a higher standard than ever before.

The following section will discuss the challenges faced by coffee roasters and producers
as well as describe the ``state of the art'' of quality control in coffee production.

\section{Coffee production challenges}
\label{sec:coffee-production-challenges}
The worsening climate conditions, rising consumer expectations and economic instability are just a few of the challenges
faced by the coffee roasting industry.
